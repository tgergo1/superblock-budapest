# Superblocks for Budapest

This project aims to explore the potential for implementing superblocks in Budapest, a traffic calming urban planning approach that has gained popularity in cities around the world for its potential to improve liveability and sustainability. 

A superblock is an area of urban land bounded by arterial roads, with the local road network within the block serving only local needs. This reduces through traffic and allows for the redesign and alternative use of streets for pedestrians and cyclists, among other possibilities. The benefits of superblocks include reduced congestion and emissions, as well as opportunities for adapting cities to climate change.

This project is still under development, and we welcome contributions and feedback from the community.
